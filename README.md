# Adilyn Rose

I'm a student at Brigham Young University, studying computer science. I'm currently exploring potential career interests; however, I'm specifically looking into software engineering, web development, human-comuter interaction, or game development.




**Projects** 

 - Currently, I'm working on a datalog interpreter for my Discrete Structures class. Here is the repository for my current progress: https://github.com/byu-cs-236-f25/project-2-roseadi000.git
 - I also programmed multiple sorts and data structures.
 - In my Introduction to Computer Science, I programmed a web scraper. If I scrapped data, I could create graphs displaying it. I could also apply filters to any photo that was scrapped.
 - I've been learning Unity and am working on starting a game project in that program.
