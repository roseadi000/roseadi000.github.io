# Adilyn Rose

I'm a student at Brigham Young University, studying computer science. I'm currently exploring potential career interests; however, I'm specifically looking into software engineering, web development, human-comuter interaction, or game development.

**Projects** 

 - Currently, I'm working on a datalog interpreter for my Discrete Structures class. Here is the repository for my current progress: https://github.com/byu-cs-236-f25/project-2-roseadi000.git
 - I also programmed multiple sorts and data structures.
 - In my Introduction to Computer Science, I programmed a web scraper. I could take information I scrapped and create graphs if it is data, or edit the photo with a specific filter if it was a photo.
